// This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
type Operation struct {

	// The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should have the format of `operations/some/unique/name`.
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`

	// Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
	Metadata map[string]string `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

	// If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If true, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
	Done bool `json:"done,omitempty"`

	// The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
	Error_ Status `json:"error,omitempty"`

	// The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
	Response map[string]string `json:"response,omitempty"`
